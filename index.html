      <h1>Stick software</h1>
      <p>A stick can be big and a stick can be small, it can have leafs or be bare, it can be a sword, a cane or a wand. No matter how you choose to see a stick, it is still a stick and should not try to be anything else but a stick. It is always easy to use, because a stick is simple. The use cases can be many, but a stick is always just a stick. Even though it can be a pretty stick, an ugly stick, a strong stick, a small stick, it’s just a stick. It’s not complicated. It doesn’t take long to see how the stick is shaped. You can easily find all the nooks and crannies. 
        </br></br>

        If you brake the stick, you have either used the stick for the wrong task or the stick wasn’t strong enough to do what you needed. You can help a stick grow by nursing the tree. If you are lucky, you can even shape the stick. Just don’t expect the stick to be a car. It will just end up a crooked stick which can not be used as a car and not really anything else.  
        </br></br>
        Some problems can be handled with a single stick. Some problems take multiple sticks. If you want to solve more complex problems using multiple stick, they need to work together. The better the sticks work together the easier it is solving the big problems. Build a house? No problem. I just need a lot of sticks who work well together. It doesn’t matter if all the sticks come from the same tree or forrest. Sometimes it’s convenient getting sticks from the same place, because you are used to that type of stick. The sticks should, however, be able to be used with other sticks. It doesn’t have to be made for other sticks, but it should be able to be used with other sticks. 
        </br></br>
        Build a simple stick which solves a problem and is easy to use with other sticks. Then you have mastered software.
